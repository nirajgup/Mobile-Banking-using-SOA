Mobile-Banking-using-SOA
========================

This was a Undergrad Final year project.
Here we created a mobile banking application which used to communicate with a server. 
The server has different back-end technology to demonstrate Service-Oriented Architecture.

The two applications name Mobile application and the Web application are placed in different folders.
The Mobile Application and Web Applicaiton are two seperate java applications.
For Mobile Applicaiton J2ME technology was used.
